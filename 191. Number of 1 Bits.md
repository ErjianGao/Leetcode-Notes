### Solution 1: Bit Arithmetic

Background knowledge: 

`n & (n - 1)` means changing the rightmost integer 1 in binary n to 0.

In this way, we can compute `n & (n - 1)` in a while loop until `n != 0`, and count the number of loops at the same time. 

> In Java, the compiler represents the signed integers using 2's complement notation. In this case, the input will be given as a signed integer type. It should not affect your implementation, as the integer's internal binary representation is the same, whether it is signed or unsigned.

```
public class Solution {
    public int hammingWeight(int n) {
        int res = 0;
        // the first number in binary n might be 1
        // so we can not use the equation (n > 0) to check
        while (n != 0) {
            n &= n - 1;
            res++;
        }
        return res;
    }
}
```

### Solution 2: count the number of 1

Simpler solution than above. 

```java
public class Solution {
    // you need to treat n as an unsigned value
    public int hammingWeight(int n) {
        int res = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < 32; i++) {
            if ((n & 1) == 1) {
                res++;
            }
            n >>= 1;
        }
        return res;
    }
}
```
