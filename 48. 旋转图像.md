### 思路 operate matrix

First, we noticed the laws in rotating the matrix by 90 degrees, as follows. 

- elements in raw i would be rotated to column (len - i - 1 )
- elements in column j would be rotated to raw j

However, if we want to rotate the matrix without other space, we need to store the element temporarily.

We only need to rotate a quarter of the matrix according to the laws found before.

```java
	public void rotate(int[][] matrix) {
        int n = matrix.length;
        if (n == 0) {
            return;
        }
        // Here is to leave the middle element unchanged when n is odd
        for (int i = 0; i < n / 2; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < (n + 1) / 2; j++) {
                int temp = matrix[i][j];
                matrix[i][j] = matrix[n - j - 1][i];
                matrix[n - j - 1][i] = matrix[n - i - 1][n - j - 1];
                matrix[n - i - 1][n - j - 1] = matrix[j][n - i - 1];
                matrix[j][n - i - 1] = temp;
            }
        }
    }
```
