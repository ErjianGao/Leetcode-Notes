### Solution: monotonic stack

When we want to deal with the rotation problems, we just need to duplicate the string or array as an extension to the original one. 

Loop once, we can get the Next Greater Number of a normal array.
Loop twice, we can get the Next Greater Number of a circular array

e.g. “dawd” -> “dawddawd”

Like the #496 question, we can store the the numbers in stack in a decreasing order. And instead of storing the value of number, we store the index of number this time. Because it is easy by doing this when we want to get the index of number. (`res[stack.pop()] = nums[i % n]`)

```java
class Solution {
    public int[] nextGreaterElements(int[] nums) {
        int n = nums.length;
        int[] res = new int[n];
        Arrays.fill(res, -1);
        Deque<Integer> stack = new ArrayDeque<>();
        for (int i = 0; i < n * 2; i++) {
            while (!stack.isEmpty() && nums[stack.peek()] < nums[i % n]) {
                res[stack.pop()] = nums[i % n];
            }
            if (i < n) {
                stack.push(i);
            }
        }
        return res;
    }
}
```
