### Solution: DFS

Concise code & easy to think.

Search the coin array recursively. If the sum of coins matches the amount, auto increase the result. 

However, there are lots of repetitive calculations in DFS. The time complexity is (less than) O(n \* 2^n^), because every number has two options, selected or not selected. Time limit exceed. 

```java
class Solution {
    int res;
    public int change(int amount, int[] coins) {
        if (amount == 0) {
            return 1;
        }
        res = 0;
        dfs(coins, amount, 0);
        return res;
    }

    public void dfs(int[] coins, int amount, int index) {
        if (amount < 0) {
            return;
        }
        if (amount == 0) {
            res++;
            return;
        }
        for (int i = index; i < coins.length; i++) {
            dfs(coins, amount - coins[i], i);
        }
    }
}
```

### Solution2: Dynamic Programming (Full Backpack Problem)

State definition: 

- Define `dp[i]` as the combination number of the sum of coins equals to `i`. So the aim of this problem is to calculate the value of `dp[amount]`

State transfer equation: 

- For each dominations of coins, when we calculate `dp[i]`, if the amount of coins equals to `i - coin`, then we need to add this coin to the combinations. 
- traverse coins, for each coin, do the following operations:
  - traverse `i` from `coin` to `amount - coin`

The result would not be repetitive. Because the outer loop traverses the dominations of coins, the inner loop traverses the value of coin amount. When computing the value of `dp[i]`, the order of coins is certain. So the result would not be repetitive. 

Initiation:

- `dp[0] = 1`. If the amount of coins equals to 0, then there only one way to choose, which is not to select coins. 

```java
class Solution {
    public int change(int amount, int[] coins) {
        int[] dp = new int[amount + 1];
        dp[0] = 1;
        for (int coin : coins) {
            for (int i = coin; i <= amount; i++) {
                dp[i] += dp[i - coin];
            }
        }
        return dp[amount];
    }
}

```
