### Solution: HashMap + DP

State Define: 

- dp[i] means the longest subsequence of given difference from index 0 to index i

DP status transmition equivalent: 

- dp[nums[i]] = dp[nums[i] - difference] + 1

We can use two ways to store the value of DP

- HashMap

  store the mapping from current number to the longest length of subsequence

  ```java
  class Solution {
      public int longestSubsequence(int[] arr, int difference) {
          Map<Integer, Integer> dp = new HashMap<>();
          int maxLen = 0;
          for (int num : arr) {
              dp.put(num, dp.getOrDefault(num - difference, 0) + 1);
              maxLen = Math.max(maxLen, dp.get(num));
          }
          return maxLen;
      }
  }
  ```

- Array

  For the reason that the problem claims that the value of items in arr[] is between -10^4^ and 10^4^,  we can use array to replace the hash table to store the DP value.
