### Solution: HashMap + Monotonic Stack

We can store the greater number of each number in the hash map. 

The hard part is the monotonic stack. We define a stack to store the numbers in nums2, and keep it as decreasing order. When we meet a number that is greater than the top of stack, we pop out the top of stack until the top of stack is greater than the number or the stack is empty. 

Time complexity: O(n) due to the fact that each number in nums2 only be put in and taken out once respectively. 

Space complexity: O(n)

```java
class Solution {
    public int[] nextGreaterElement(int[] nums1, int[] nums2) {
        // build a Map to store the greater number of each number in nums2
        Map<Integer, Integer> greaterMap = new HashMap<>();
        Deque<Integer> stack = new ArrayDeque<>();
        for (int num : nums2) {
            // keep the stack decreasing
            while (!stack.isEmpty() && num > stack.peek()) {
                greaterMap.put(stack.pop(), num);
            }
            stack.push(num);
        }
        for (int i = 0; i < nums1.length; i++) {
            nums1[i] = greaterMap.getOrDefault(nums1[i], -1);
        }
        return nums1;
    }
}
```
