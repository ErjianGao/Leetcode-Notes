### Solution: two pointers

set two pointers left and right. all numbers to the left of the left pointer are not 0. Right pointer indicates the head of remaining list. 

- Right pointer move one position to the right every time. 
- when meet a number that is not zero, swap the numbers in left pointer and right pointer, and move left pointer to the right by one position.

```java
class Solution {
    public void moveZeroes(int[] nums) {
        int left = 0;
        int right = 0;
        int n = nums.length;
        while (right < n) {
            if (nums[right] != 0) {
                swap(nums, left, right);
                left++;
            }
            // when the number is zero, don't move left pointer
            // when right pointer meets zero, swap the left and the right pointer
            right++;
        }
    }

    public void swap(int[] nums, int a, int b) {
        int tmp = nums[a];
        nums[a] = nums[b];
        nums[b] = tmp;
    }
}
```
